# 🎨 Animated Lissajous Curves  

Welcome to my **first project using GitHub and Python**! 🚀  
This project is a simple but cool visualization built with `matplotlib` that generates and animates **Lissajous curves** — beautiful looping patterns created by combining sine waves.  

---

## ✨ What the project does  

The script uses **matplotlib** to:  
- Plot a Lissajous curve (a curve formed by two sine functions with different frequencies).  
- Animate the curve so it looks like it’s constantly shifting and evolving.  
- Cycle through a **color gradient** to make the animation visually engaging.  

In short, it’s a small but eye-catching math + art project! 🎶📈

## 🧮 How it works  

- The equations behind the curve are:  
  - `x = sin(a * t + δ)`  
  - `y = sin(b * t)`  

- `a` and `b` are frequencies that control how the waves overlap.  
- `δ` (delta) is a phase shift that changes how the patterns line up.  
- By continuously updating these values over time, the pattern animates.
